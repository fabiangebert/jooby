== Modules

Modules are a key concept for building reusable and configurable pieces of software.

Modules (unlike in other frameworks) are thin and do a lot of work to bootstrap and configure an 
external library, but they DO NOT provide a new level of abstraction nor [do] they provide a custom
API to access functionality in that library. Instead they expose the library components as they are.

Modules are distributed as separated jar/dependency and usually implement the javadoc:Extension[] API.

In general they provide a `builder` class to create the and configure the external library from 
configuration properties.
